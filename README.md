# Text-Shuffling-Encryptor
This is an amazing application which allows the user to encrypt whatever that is written using this app. It's similar to Notepad but while saving, it encrypts the file and while opening the same file, it decrypts and shows the original format. It simply means no one can open your file without using this app's help.


Note: This app is just for testing purposes. You may have figured out that, even if this app encrypts (shuffles the text) your file, you can easily decrypt it using the same app. I will eventually put pin support in this app but for now, the encryption and decryption is working completely fine. I will also update some other things and put it inside the app and upload it again. There will be two folders among which one will contain the first version and the other will contain the updated version.

Note: This above is the example of what the program does.
Important thing to know is that (You shouldn't name the files having same names in different locations) (The name once used shouldn't be used again)

Note: Update: I've updated the file and there will be more and more updates later on. This update contains a feature where you are not allowed to create two files of same name. But when you try to do that, the program will automatically change your file's name and put numbers behind it. For Example:
"hello.txt" is already encrypted and it already exists somewhere (Anywhere in your computer)
Now, if you try to name "hello.txt" and save it in any other location, it instead becomes saved by the name "hello1.txt" and further on. Thank You.

Note: Update: I've again updated the file and there will still be more updates later on. This update contains a feature where you are allowed to get "Help" from the 
Help Section. In the help section, 3 options are added (i.e "How To Use?", "Backup","Clear Data"). If you wish to know how to use the app, then simply head to Help
Section and select the How To Use? option which will tell you exactly how you can use this app. If you wish to backup all your encrypted files at once, you can click
Backup from the same option and if you wish to Clear All The Files That You Have Ever Created From The Application, You Can Easily Click Clear Data From The Same Option.
Thank You

# Text-Shuffling-Encryptor
This is an amazing application which allows the user to encrypt whatever that is written using this app. It's similar to Notepad but while saving, it encrypts the file and while opening the same file, it decrypts and shows the original format. It simply means no one can open your file without using this app's help.


Note: This app is just for testing purposes. You may have figured out that, even if this app encrypts (shuffles the text) your file, you can easily decrypt it using the same app. I will eventually put pin support in this app but for now, the encryption and decryption is working completely fine. I will also update some other things and put it inside the app and upload it again. There will be two folders among which one will contain the first version and the other will contain the updated version.

Note: This above is the example of what the program does.
Important thing to know is that (You shouldn't name the files having same names in different locations) (The name once used shouldn't be used again)
